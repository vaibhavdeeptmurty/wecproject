## Notes
  -Firestore Storage needed me to go premium, which is why I am using Cloudinary for storing images.
  -I was unable to resolve the error while using Polylines, which is why I have not added the Live location feature. On pub.dev, the documentation is outdated and no longer works for newer versions. If I use the old version, I would need to reduce the versions of many dependencies and change the code accordingly.
